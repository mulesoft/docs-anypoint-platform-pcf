:keywords: pcf, pivotal cloud foundry,

The Anypoint Platform for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) component is a fully integrated solution that enables organizations to design, develop, deploy, manage, and operate APIs, connectivity apps and microservices within the infrastructure provided by Pivotal Cloud Foundry.

The Anypoint Platform for PCF solution enables you to:

* Deploy Mule applications to PCF using the Runtime Manager UI.
* Create and deploy a Mule proxy application to PCF. A proxy application intercepts traffic to a non-Mule application, enabling you to apply policies and view usage metrics.

If you are using Anypoint Platform for PCF and you have multiple PCF installations, each must be linked to its own separate installation of Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition.

If you have a PCF installation with multiple spaces, you must run the *Space Configuration Tool* on each of these spaces. If your Anypoint Platform organization uses multiple environments, it is recommended that you have one PCF space for each.

Anypoint Platform for PCF uses the following services:

* **Runtime Manager Service**: exposes PCF as a deployment target within the Anypoint Runtime Manager and lets you deploy Mule applications to PCF, alongside other deployment targets.

* **API Gateway Service**: enables you to create and deploy a Mule API proxy that intercepts traffic to a non-Mule application running on PCF. This allows you to use the MuleSoft interface to apply policies over the API and the PCF interface to view usage and policy metrics.

* **Anypoint Metering Service**: provides an API that enables you to view usage metrics for Mule applications deployed to PCF. You can view usage metrics for production, pre-production, staging, and development environments.

== What PCF Supports

When running Mule on Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) and using the cloud-hosted control plane, deploy Runtime Fabric for Mule deployments alongside your PCF environment, as this provides better integration of Anypoint Platform, support for managed patches, and new runtime versions.

If you choose not to use the cloud-hosted control plane, use the native PCF tooling for deploying and managing Mule on PCF.

=== What does MuleSoft provide?

==== Buildpacks for Mule runtimes
MuleSoft provides a buildpack for each of the following versions of the Mule runtime. These buildpacks enable you to deploy their applications to PCF using native tooling.

***** Mule 3.9.1
***** Mule 3.8.7
***** Mule 3.8.5
***** Mule 3.8.1
==== Anypoint Platform Tile
The Anypoint Platform Tile contains 3 service brokers, which perform the following actions:

***** Manage Mule applications in PCE v1.6.1 or earlier.
***** Manage API policies in PCE v1.6.1 or earlier.
***** Count incoming transactions to deployed Mules.

The first two service brokers are no longer compatible with Anypoint Private Cloud Edition (PCE) as of v1.7 and later. 
The third service broker is used to count the number of incoming transactions for each Mule application or API. Coupled with a metering plugin which resides on each Mule buildpack, this service broker generates reports for auditing and licensing purposes. The service was built to support a transaction-based pricing model for Mules deployed on PCF.

=== What is supported with PCF?

==== On-premise standalone

===== Mule Application Deployments
In practice, customers use the native tooling (API, CLI) that PCF provides to deploy and manage their Mule applications similar to other applications they deploy and manage on PCF. 

With the native tooling, customers can perform the following actions:

****** Deploy applications with CLI, API, or a common build pipeline
****** Set custom properties.
****** Horizontally scale their Mule applications by increasing the number of replicas.
****** Specify the version of the Mule runtime per application.
****** Specify the amount of memory for each application replica.
****** Cluster Mule runtimes by setting up an externalized HazelCast service broker.
****** Configuring the application endpoint name.
****** Start, stop, and delete Mule applications.
****** View monitoring data and set alerting via PCF metrics.
****** Re-deploy without downtime, with support for blue/green deployments.
****** Automatic failover of Mule applications.

===== API Policy Management 
API policies are supported with the following additional setup:

For PCE versions 1.6.x and 1.7.x:

. Deploy an app:

.. Deploy an app using `cf push <app>` with the manifest file or typical `cf` commands.
.. After the app is created, run `cf app <app>` and make note of the app URL.
. Deploy a proxy application:
               
.. Use the PCE instance to get properties.
+
----
-Dapi.name=<customerApp name>     
-Dapi.version=<version of the app ex: 1.0>    
-Dimplementation.host=<url of customerapp ex: springboot.apps.santafesprings.cf-app.com>
-Dimplementation.port=80 
-Dimplementation.path=/ 
-Danypoint.platform.client_id=<clientId property that you have for the org ex: cdbff39bfa4741fb9bb531ba6102a578> 
-Danypoint.platform.client_secret=<ClientId secret of the org ex: 56bB958Bc257464B9fF0A9F9E6Af9890>

-Danypoint.platform.contracts_base_uri=< ex: https://qax.anypoint.mulesoft.com/apigateway/ccs>

.. After gathering all the properties, deploy the proxy:
+
----
. cf push <proxy> -b <mulebuildpackname> -p <proxy app that mulesoft provided> --no-start
. cf set-env <proxy-app> mcm_anypoint_metering_plan_unlimited true
. cf set-env <proxy-app> MULE_JAVA_OPTS "-Dapi.name=muleapp -Dapi.version=1.0

-Danypoint.platform.client_secret=BbCA70Bb056F437e94C707B67aF4284D
-Danypoint.platform.platform_base_uri=https://161-171-upgrade-2056596225.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com/apiplatform

. cf start <proxy>
----

.. Tail the logs by running `cf logs <proxy>`.

***  The 2018-11-13T10:07:09.52-0800 [APP/PROC/WEB/0] OUT INFO  2018-11-13 18:07:09,494 [agw-policy-polling.01] com.mulesoft.module.policies.lifecyle.GateKeeper log should indicate that API <proxyappname> <version> is now unblocked.

*** In the PCE instance of API manager, the proxy auto registers with status as ACTIVE. If you see `401` or `500` errors in the logs, make sure you have sufficient permissions to create an API in API manager. The proxy uses the properties provided in the previous step.

.. Create a user service instance for the proxy app using the following command:
+
----
`cf create-user-provided-service SERVICE-INSTANCE -r ROUTE-SERVICE-URL`
----
... For example, `cf create-user-provided-service muleappproxy -r https://muleappproxy.apps.santafesprings.cf-app.com`.
... For additional information, refer to https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/route-services.html#user-provided[User-Provided Service, role=external, window=_blank].

.. Bind or create a route between proxyApp and the app using the following command:
+
----
cf bind-route-service DOMAIN SERVICE-INSTANCE [--hostname HOSTNAME]
----

... For example, `cf bind-route-service apps.santafesprings.cf-app.com muleappproxy --hostname springbootapp`.

.. Verify the app URL

... To make sure that the app is getting routed through the proxy with policies applied, 
hit the URL of the app to ensure it is reachable. You should see multiple logs. If not, then there is an issue with 
routing or the proxy app.
... In the PCE instance of API Manager, configure policies for proxyAPI.
... Apply simple auth and httpauth. You should see policies getting applied to logs in proxyapp logs.
... Go to the customer app and it should now ask for the authorization that you configured in API manager.

====== For CloudHub (anypoint.mulesoft.com) and latest PCE instance 2.0.0:

. For API manager 2.0, perform the steps in xref:api-manager/2.x/configure-autodiscovery-3-task.adoc [Configuring API Gateway API Autodiscovery in a Mule 3 Application, role=external, window=_blank].
. Register the API in API manager.
. Use the API name and version provided by the API manager to configure the properties:
+
----
-Dapi.name=<long App name from API manager> ex: groupId:cef274d5-780e-48e2-9081-e98d5cfc6113:assetId:proxyapp     
-Dapi.version=<version of the app ex: v1:136567>
----
. Make sure you created the API in the environment from which `clientId` and `secret` are provided to the proxy. `clientId` and `secret` apply to the environment, not the organization. For example:
----
cf set-env muleappproxy MULE_JAVA_OPTS
-Dapi.name=groupId:cef274d5-780e-48e2-9081-e98d5cfc6113:assetId:mm
-Dapi.version=v1:136567 -Dimplementation.host=muleapp.apps.santafesprings.cf-app.com
-Dimplementation.port=80 -Dimplementation.path=/
-Danypoint.platform.client_id=cdbff39bfa4741fb9bb531ba6102a578
